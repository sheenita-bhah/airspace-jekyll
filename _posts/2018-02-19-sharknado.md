subtitle: Oh Shepherd! Why Sharknado films I & II are rife with godly truths...
---

You guys know I am the coolest, right? I keep up to date with current affairs, read the latest best sellers and watch the biggest films every year. So it was natural that I was going to start the biggest film franchise of the 21st century: Sharknado.

While the plot was gripping and it kept me on the edge of my blanket for the entire runtime of the films, walking away afterwards I was left with some heavy questions on my mind. They were deeply burdening me, so I naturally felt the need to enter my zone, the holy state of mind that is conspiring.

I've been professionally conspiring for the past 60 years; you realise I was the guy who came up with the fake moon landing conspiracy? I was there through it all, and although I've left the Flat Earthers for now, they will always be a part of my life.

So let's dive into the first Sharknado film...

Here we run into Fin Shepherd, an ex-pro surfer and a bar owner. His bar situated stupidly on the end of a pier is unfortunately one of the first victims of the attack of the vicious sharks flung around by the rapidly rotating column of air. He, along with his friends, must make their way across Los Angeles to save his family and ultimately destroy the tornado that is rampaging the city.

Sounds like a pretty straightforward story, but I beg to differ. Let's lay out all the points.

1. __Is California even a real place?__

    We all know that Sharknado was based on real events. But I have currently been unable to unearth any news articles supporting this claim. The most logical reasoning is that much like the Lost City of Atlantis, California has a rife mythical history. It was most likely split in two by a deadly earthquake along the San Andreas fault line directly after the attack, with one half being buried deep in the Pacific Ocean, but not before the Sharknado attacked and destroyed civilisation. You might ask who would cover up such a tragedy, who would be so heartless to leave us in the dark of these events and the enormous death toll. There is only one person responsible: Barack Obama.
    Can(a) you defend yourself with a barstool?


2.  __Is a barstool really an effective weapon?__

    In the beginning of the film, just after the Sharknado has begun to wreck havoc upon the US coast, George - a drunk local in Fin's bar who's untimely death was the biggest tragedy of the film - begins to use a barstool to defend himself against the Great Whites. As much as it was a cool shoot, it got me thinking about the effectiveness of it as a weapon. Now, you might be thinking that I am being a bit too realistic in my evaluation here, but when the next Sharknado occurs, I want to be prepared. Of course, the barstool does have the advantages of being so sticky that you don't have to worry about losing grip and the bacteria alone found on it could kill a shark if the right contact is made. The disadvantages however include the fact that they tend to contain those little rubber swizzles, which will reduce the blunt force impact, and that they are hard to come across in the wild if you don't live in Zimbabwe. Regardless, I do expect to see a barstool in the newest version of Cluedo.

3.  __Do all tornadoes contain sharks?__

    Yes. That's the short answer. Have you ever actually seen a tornado? Don't call me out for "assuming your life story" but I know for a fact you haven't. Since the beginning of modern records, the "tornadoes" that you may know and love have been recorded, but I have something to tell you: they aren't real tornadoes. These "fakenadoes" have been plaguing our society and convincing people that Sharknadoes are not real (thanks again Barack), but I am here to tell you the truth. You have films like "Twister" and "The Wizard of Oz" to blame for perpetuating the stereotype that Sharknado has come to break down. The truth has finally been revealed, and we can all be involved with it.

I must wrap up my rantings before I reveal too many secrets. I already have the CIA and MI5 on my back and I do not wish to expand the list of agencies tracking my every move. Now I have planted the seeds of doubt in your minds, I aspire for you to go forth (and multiply) and spread the message.

Till next time peasants...
