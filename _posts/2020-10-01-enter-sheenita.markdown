Going into 2020, there was a feeling of optimism in the Bhah-Sexon household. In our final year and finally residing in a residence outside of the reach of the FBI, my partner and I were finally able to begin work on many of our life goals. After reflecting on the previous years and how my fame had skyrocketed through my social influencing work on instagram and exposés on my own blog Conspire with Bee, I had difficulty deciding what my resolution should have been for the new year. It ressembles the dilemmna, what to get for the person who has everything?

After much thought, I realised that, while I was finding that my blog and instagram were finally reaching their viewership peaks, on a personal level I was beginning to stagnate. My exposés were not as hard hitting as they once were and I often lacked the resources to make them publicly available due to governmental interferences. I was beginning to feel some frustration. I needed an uncovering that would shatter the world's view on life. It would have to be a story that necessated immediate broadcast around the world due to its sheer disquieting nature.

It is then that I decided to undertake my most ambitious exposition to date. It was a venture to defeat my number one nemesis in the field of conspiracies, who's name leaves the bourgeois quaking in their non-vegan boots. I was about to take on... **the Illuminati!**

Now, you may say that this was an obvious target for a conspiricist such as myself, and to some extent you may be right. It has long been a dream of mine to take on such a global behemoth but until now it has been just that - a dream. The realities of going toe to toe with the giants of the conspiracy game is that it is near impossible to have the sort of manpower needed to unravel the whole institution. It is for this reason that I completed a degree in Computer Science: to gain the skills necessary for this mission.

The first few months of the year were spent in the deserts of Saudi Arabia finding an informant that my dear friend Steve Vickers turned me onto. I searched high and low, following a map that could've been mistaken for one pointing out a pirate's treasure, until finally I found what I was looking for. For security reasons, I am unable to name my mole inside the Illuminati but what I can say is with him I found a wealth of invaluable information.

By March, I had collected enough information on the higher-ups in the organisation to try some more hands on tactics. I was planning to travel to deepest darkest Peru where I learnt one of my targets had constructed a fortress. I hoped to perform a covert reconnaissance mission to steal influential documents that would expose a link between the Illuminati and the whereabouts of Donald Duck's underwear. However, I decided to stop back in the UK to see my husband after many months apart.

It is at this point where readers will stop with some recognition at where my story is headed. Not long after I had landed, Boris Johnson had declared a national lockdown and the country stood still. People began stockpiling - supposedly thinking a fort made out of toilet paper would protect them from coronavirus - and I was unable to buy a head of lettuce for six whole weeks. To put it quite frankly - the world was going to shit.

My contacts that had promised to fly me to South America suddenly no longer had the capability to do so and while I was willing to cross the Atlantic à la Greta Thunberg, my husband was less keen on the idea. Now, my readers will know that I am generally reserved when it comes to talking about my husband and her family but for the purposes of narration of this tale, I will share that we faced some marriage troubles throughout lockdown. There were even threats of her moving to Norwich to live with her mistress on more than one occasion. We were struggling - as was the whole world.

The conspiricist in me wants to believe that Coronavirus is a hoax made up by government agents to impede my mission, preventing me from uncovering more holy truths. However, believing such things would put me on the same level as the Covid-denying Americans, which I vehemently refuse.

In addition, readership of my conspiracy blog was beginning to dry up. It seemed that people no longer cared about my truths about Jesus being an emo when the literal apocalypse was happening. I needed an extra source of income to support my ever growing family and I needed it fast. There began the start of my empire: Sheenita Bhah Ltd. My business has seen growth in its first few months of infancy with a thriving greeting card line and the establishment of Sheenita Bhah Comics© (available at your local Tesco or Asda). I admit that my creativity has seen no bounds and I would be well on my way to becoming the next Disney - if I believed in capitalism, that is. 

Despite these adventures, I still find myself missing the excitement of conspiring. No amount of crack can replace the feeling of finding some new, ground-breaking evidence and having to live on the run from people who don't want you to publish it. It has been hard to accept that my current mission has been put on hold and that I needed to find other ways of supporting and expressing myself, but it is something I have had to adjust to.

It has truly been the longest year on earth, but what will see me through is the knowledge that - one day - I will get back to what I do best. Conspiring.
