 Hello again my dear worshippers. As you are very much aware, this is a blog primarily concerned with the various conspiracy theories that I have proven over my many long years on earth. However, given the exponential decay of my outreach, I felt like things needed to be shaken up. After great deliberation, I have chosen to reveal to you all a theory that I, the great Sheenita of Bhah, have conjured up over the years. Never before has this theory been revealed to anyone, and so I hope you all abide by the principles of the GDPR, and reveal none of these very much personal details to anyone outside of this TLS secure and trusting conspiring family. 

By now, you should know that I am married to my life long friend and heir to the Zimbabwean thrown, Ayla. We're always in perfect synchronisation, whether it's deciding what to wear from our remarkably similar wardrobes, or when we want to go and have a Costa coffee. There is truly nothing that we have ever disagreed on. Until a few days ago...

Lately, Ayla has been very busy as she has started taking Judo classes as part of the University of Birmingham's 'Try a Sport' scheme. Despite our age, she has been practising relentlessly, and you should expect to see her representing Zim in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. However, with all of the new doors that open in our lives many also will shut, and to put it bluntly there are only a finite number of door stoppers one can have. (For a proof of this, please consult the Great Steve Of Vickers). As she has been so busy practising, she forgot to attend our weekly discussion about Mars, and the many many conspiracy's surrounding it. Naturally, I was forced to ponder the possibility of alien life alone, which unleased a whole new theory. This is something my husband tries to limit due to my apparent 'vivid' imagination. I'm sure you can very much imagine his anger when he returned that night, to find a crime board exploring every possible loophole in my theory. What began with her taking down the pins and red wool, escalated into our very first full-blown argument. Unfortunately, she walked out before I was able to fully explain my theory. I was all sassy like "Bye Felicia," but I guess the fact that I am writing this all down right now suggests that I am still yearning to get my truth out to the world.

So here it is, my truth, my child, my newest hypothesis. 

    "Everything we dream is a mirage into the lives of our alternative selves in the multiverse."

Before you head to the comments; my social media; or even my house with your spiteful words, hear my postulates out. Also if your name is MessageToEagle and you are reading this, let me just say your "post" on this subject matter is quite frankly crap. You really need to read up on how to entertain readers, although judging from the pure lack of backing in your claims, I'm guessing you haven't yet learnt to read.

Disclamer- I am not a qualified theoretical physics (yet), but I am working very hard to complete my PhD in it. I can therefore assure you that all of the science below is 100% accurate with current knowledge.

Inductive Hypothesis - Alternative/Parallel Universes do in fact exist.
(Dis)proving such multiverse theories is a task beyond the immediate scope of this article. If you really want to find out more, do a quick google search (or if you want to help save the environment and crush capitalism, may I suggest Ecosia üòè). Also, if you really want to procrastinate, I suggest watching all of the DC universe tv shows (particularly The Flash), as they explain the intricacies of such theories very well.

+   Inductive Step 1 - 
    
    Standard DreamOften our dreams are so close to reality that we wake up and spend a few seconds wondering if it was a dream or actually something that happened to us in the past. My theory states that said dreams are actually glimpses into the lives of ourselves in alternative universes. So what evidence do I actually have to support this claim?

Lets take some very well picked lyrics from a couple of sweet tunes as a point of reference.

1.  Dreams - Gabrielle

    "Dreams can come true." 

2.  Dream On - Aerosmith
    
    "Dream until your dreams come true."

3.  Dream - Imagine Dragons
        
    "We are all living in a dream"

4.  666 The Number Of The Beast - Iron Maiden

    "Just what I saw in my old dreams. Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?" 

5.  Infinite Dreams - Iron Maiden
    
    "Scared to fall asleep again in case the dream begins again. Someone chasing I cannot move, standing rigid a nightmare's statue. What a dream when will it end, and will it transcend?"

Personally, I find it very suspicious that there are so many songs that draw upon this subject matter. Song number five proves itself to be the most powerful of all of the above, as it highlights the continuity of some dreams. This mirrors nicely the continuity of life itself, and strengthens my argument. Clearly, Bruce Dickson and Blaze Bayley have had some very fascinating and possibly traumatic dreams. Naturally I 'visited' them both backstage during the iconic Prayer On The Road tour back in the 90's. Of course, this fact has no mere relevance to the point I'm making here: I just wanted to show off.

We can also take his all mighty, praise the lord, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and his famous March on Washington speech in 1963. Here, you can find a full transcript just in case you wish to have his beautiful voice reverberate through your ears. The march was carried out in protest for equal job rights and true freedom from slavery for the hundreds and thousands of African Americans. You can imagine that many of MLK's dreams were concerned with this matter, and so he references them dearly within his speech. The point that I deemed to be most poignant as evidence to my theory is the following:

    "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."

It seems fitting for a father to frequently dream of the success of his children: we all do it. Personally I wish that my youngest child realises that becoming a tractor is not a sustainable way to live, and realises that he has the potential to becoming a world class conspirer. For a great man such as Reverend King Jr., praise the lord, to internationally, on the racist black and white television, broadcast the connection that he feels to his dreams, truly does provide a huge confirmation to my theory.

+   Inductive Step 2 - 

    Dreams Where You See Your Own Future
    All versions of yourself are mentally connected. Lets face it, we're all made up of particles that make us who we are. All versions of ourselves look the same and have similar traits to us. It becomes rather evident that there must be a sharing of particles between all versions of oneself, and thus we are connected via such similarities. However, we must consider the implication of this particle sharing. which is that only the versions of yourself formed after you can influence the path of your life.
    If we consider the Minkowski based space-time theories, the universe is considered to be in a fixed state no matter what, e.g. time is the 4th dimension. To put the implications of this into simplistic terms: our fates are predetermined meaning that no matter what 'free' choices we make, the end result of our cumulative actions will be the same.
    Taking both of these proofs into consideration, allows me to neatly prove my theory for such dreams by stating the following; "If something happens to Earth 'n' Ayla, then it is highly possible that said event will also happen to the Earth 0...n-1 Ayla's."

+   Inductive Step 3 - Dreams Where You Are Not Involved
    
    Much like in life, we aren't always involved in the scenes that we witness. I have recently started killing wasps using premium Aldi value wasp killer, and unsurprisingly my dreams lately have been centered around the lives of a family of wasps who are constantly dealing with new deaths in the family. It's almost like an animated series, much like The Simpsons, where I am nothing but the helpless viewer. I henceforth find this step to be relatively self justified, as it follows the same argument as Step 1. 

Of course, I have only lightly touched on the intricacies of my theory, and so have not fully delved into the scientific support and human research that I have carried out. There are a number of reasons for this, the primary reason being that I do not want other fake conspirers to take ahold of my findings and stake them as their own, (I'm looking at you MessageToEagle...yes, literally looking. I hacked into your webcam...nice Iron Man bed sheets btw). If you want to find out more, feel free to cheekily slide into my DM's, and for a price I may entrust you with the nitty gritty of the theory üòèüòè. It appears that I have in fact now reached by very late bedtime of 10pm, and soon my parents will call me to ensure I am tucked up in bed. So goodnight to you all, and until we speak again, do not speak about what you have read here to anyone.
