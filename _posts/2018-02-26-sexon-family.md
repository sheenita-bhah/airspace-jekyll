 I know what youâ€™re thinking right now, partly because I am an ex professional mind reader, and partly because over the years history has been corrupted. Much like the forgotten royals of Myanmar, the royal Zimbabwean family have been lost over time. Rumour has it that my grandfather in law, his royal highness Mugabe, was actually responsible for the complete annihilation of the Sexons from the history books. After years of undercover work, including marrying a member of their family, I have finally got the full scoop on Zimbabwe's former power house family. So roll up into your blankets and get ready for some top notch hippo drama.

So Zimbabwe didn't actually exist until 1980 when the former lord of the Shire of Banana, Canaan Banana, rode his hippo across the Indian Ocean. Like every great conquerer, he destroyed the Rhodesians and invited over some of his pals from home so that they could have their much needed lad's holiday. Like the clueless peasant you are, you're probably questioning the truth behind anything I am writing here today. How dare you? 

During what is now known as the Zimbalution, I was actually in South Africa helping Nelson Mandela with his pre-presidential campaigns. South Africa and Rhodesia had a form of communication using birds, which eventually evolved into what is known as Twitter, and after a while these tweets stopped coming through from Rhodesia. The South Africans began to fear that their favourite nation had been bombed by the IRA1, and so sent troops on elephant back to investiagate. Nelson asked me to go along on his behalf, and gather some much needed information that would help to spearhead his campaign. 

Fast forward a few years, and Rhodesia had re-built itself, under the ruling of Canaan Banana, as the country now known as Zimbabwe. He and his wife Janet, had four children, the oldest of which succeeded him upon his resignation from office in 1987. Robert Mugabe ruled over Zimbabwe until November 2017, when he was forced to resign for a number of reasons that are irrelevant to this post.

How did Mugabe manage to stay in charge for 40 years, without being unchallenged? 
This is where the Sexons come in. As many of you know, Mugabe actually married twice; Sally Hafron in 1961 and then Grace Marufu in 1996, after the death of the former.
There is only one recorded child between Sally and Robert and his name was Michael. He however died from Malaria at the age of three in 1966 whilst he was with Sally in Ghana... or did he?

During this time, Mugabe had been imprisoned in the Southern Queensland Correction Centre, after he had been caught aiding the British in their disgusting child emigration to Australia scheme (as shown in the smash hit Oranges and Sunshine). Taking this into consideration it becomes obvious that Michael was not actually Mugabe's blood son, but a child that he and his wife had 'adopted' through this scheme. Once his father found out, they had no choice but to pronounce him dead.

Micheal was sent to South Africa on a banana boat, and his name was changed to Geoff Malone by his adopted family - the Sexons. Naturally he lived his life unaware of his true royal heritage, and so could not challenge the Zimbwean throne from his father. This left Mugabe ruling Zimbabwe for half of my life.

The Rise Of Geoff Malone...
Through starting up the worlds biggest technology company, Sexon Technologies, Geoff found himself using Zimbabwe as his base of operations. This is where he met Chazza, who he later married and had three children with. This family is what I like to call The Lost Royals of Zimbabwe. Pretty pimp band name don't you think?

Sexon Technologies was eventually taken over by the Capitalist gang leader, Google. Geoff decidedto take on a new hobby, and began researching into his past. He became hooked on a feeling that something did not quite add up. This is when we first met, and I told him everything I knew about his life. I'd like to mention that I was unaware of the true nature of Mugabe's imprisonment at this point in history, and so Geoff did not know of his potential English heritage.
He no longer felt safe in Zimbabwe; what if Mugabe found out who he truly was? What would happen to him and his family? If word got out he could not bear the thought of risking the lives of his children. He packed up his bags, and took his family to England on hippo-back, as it was the only other language he could fluently and comfortably speak. Quite a nice circle of life don't you think?

Using the skills I picked up during my Sofware Engineering days (full creds to my top man Alan Sexton), I drew up a quick UML Diagram. This particular diagram is the actual Zimbabwean royal family tree.

Sadly, Geoff never managed to find his real family, but he is quite content with his new life in England. Sometimes he still gets upset by the fact he never got the chance to be the King of Zim, and so has decided to become a professional rapper, in the hopes he can take the title of the King of Rap from Eminem.

So now you know the real truth about Mugabe and Zimbabwe. Don't you feel like a bossman?
I can hear Alya shouting at me from upstair. I'm guessing she's ran out of butternut squashes, so I better be off before she turns into the Hungry Hungry HippoTM
Till next time peasants..

1 The IRA were a major force of destruction in South Africa as well as England/Ireland. If you look at this page, you can see that there is only one recorded bombing in 1980.This is because the IRA troops decided to attack Britains favourite member of the Empire. These attacks were never publicised to the world as South Africa feared that their repuations as the 'Bad Ass African Nation' would be scrutinised.
